      "✅ PROS:\n",
      "1. Strongly typed: TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors during development and ensures better code quality.\n",
      "2. Improved code maintainability: TypeScript allows developers to write cleaner and more organized code, making it easier to maintain and understand.\n",
      "3. Better tooling support: TypeScript integrates well with popular development tools like Visual Studio Code, providing features like IntelliSense, code navigation, and refactoring tools.\n",
      "4. Enhanced scalability: TypeScript is ideal for larger projects as it enables developers to manage complex codebases more effectively.\n",
      "5. Compatibility with JavaScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning existing JavaScript code can be gradually migrated to TypeScript without major refactoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "❌ CONS:\n",
      "1. Steeper learning curve compared to JavaScript: TypeScript introduces new concepts such as type annotations, interfaces, and generics, which can be challenging for developers who are not familiar with statically-typed languages.\n",
      "2. Compilation overhead: The need to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript adds an extra step to the development process, which can slow down the feedback loop during development.\n",
      "3. Limited ecosystem: TypeScript may not be as widely supported as JavaScript, leading to potential compatibility issues with certain libraries, frameworks, or tools.\n",
      "4. Potential for over-engineering: The strict typing system in TypeScript may lead to developers spending more time on type annotations and configurations than on actually solving the problem at hand.\n",
      "5. Increased bundle size: TypeScript code can result in larger bundle sizes compared to pure JavaScript, which can impact performance, especially in web applications.\n"

    "- ✅ Sequential chains — pipe output of one step into the next\n",
    "- ✅ Parallel chains — run multiple chains simultaneously (`RunnableParallel`)\n",
    "- ✅ Router chains — conditional logic to pick the right chain\n",
    "- ✅ `MessagesPlaceholder` — inject dynamic message lists into prompts\n",
    "- ✅ Three memory strategies: buffer, window, summary\n",
    "- ✅ Built a reusable `StatefulChatbot` class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key concepts:**\n",
    "- **`StrOutputParser`**: Extracts plain string from LLM response\n",
    "- **`RunnablePassthrough`**: Passes input through unchanged (useful in parallel chains)\n",
    "- **`RunnableLambda`**: Wraps any Python function as a chain step\n",
    "- **`MessagesPlaceholder`**: The key to injecting chat history into a prompt template\n",
    "- **`deque(maxlen=k)`**: Python's built-in circular buffer — perfect for sliding window memory\n",
